Possibly I was very fatigued at this altitude, or disarmed by the bucolic scene, but the moment magnified intensely, as when tongues of silver waves broke into permutations under Crimson's hypnotic fireside voice. Partaking of the Kir, I gazed past Indigo at the verdant hills cascading down into Salzburg as they infused with radiant beams, with shifting rainbows over softly grazing sheep and pastoral huts and crystalline streams, as if one were in a vision of the Impressionists. Gliding flights of doves passed dreamlike over the valley beneath, as a cone of silence descended. Yet I could hear simultaneously a brook flowing kilometers away, and a pinecone dropping through tiers of branches in the descending forests, and Indigo's many and distant voices, and the sound of a far cowbell ringing like a vicar's summons. The wind in a great susurrus moved over terraced lands and patches of thistles and Queen Anne's lace as if all were the comforting wish of a restful deity. The brilliant azure sky was ablaze with heaven's light. A transparent canopy of portentous colors, it was not ominous, but inescapable and absolute, like a state of Grace. Breathing deeply, I at last could only submit to the glory.
