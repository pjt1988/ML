We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs. Reality itself is too twisted.
We can't stop here, this is bat country!
Tiger got to hunt, Bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder, "Why, why, why?" Tiger got to sleep, Bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.
God made mud. God got lonesome. So God said to some of the mud, "Sit up!" "See all I've made," said God, "the hills, the sea, the sky, the stars." And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. Lucky me, lucky mud. I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done. Nice going, God. Nobody but you could have done it, God! I certainly couldn't have. I feel very unimportant compared to You. The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look around. I got so much, and most mud got so little. Thank you for the honor! Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep. What memories for mud to have! What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met! I loved everything I saw! Good night. I will go to heaven now. I can hardly wait... To find out for certain what my wampeter was... And who was in my karass... And all the good things our karass did for you. Amen.
lucky me, lucky mud
Possibly I was very fatigued at this altitude, or disarmed by the bucolic scene, but the moment magnified intensely, as when tongues of silver waves broke into permutations under Crimson's hypnotic fireside voice. Partaking of the Kir, I gazed past Indigo at the verdant hills cascading down into Salzburg as they infused with radiant beams, with shifting rainbows over softly grazing sheep and pastoral huts and crystalline streams, as if one were in a vision of the Impressionists. Gliding flights of doves passed dreamlike over the valley beneath, as a cone of silence descended. Yet I could hear simultaneously a brook flowing kilometers away, and a pinecone dropping through tiers of branches in the descending forests, and Indigo's many and distant voices, and the sound of a far cowbell ringing like a vicar's summons. The wind in a great susurrus moved over terraced lands and patches of thistles and Queen Anne's lace as if all were the comforting wish of a restful deity. The brilliant azure sky was ablaze with heaven's light. A transparent canopy of portentous colors, it was not ominous, but inescapable and absolute, like a state of Grace. Breathing deeply, I at last could only submit to the glory.
